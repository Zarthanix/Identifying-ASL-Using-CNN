## Abstract

In this project we study the ability of an AI to recognize and track hand positions with a raspberry PI 4 with 8 GB of ram and 64 GB of storage.

**Keywords:** ai, object recognition, image processing, computer vision, hand tracking. 

## 1. Introduction

Object detection and feature selection are essential tasks in computer vision and have
been approached from various perspectives over the past few decades [9, 14, 27, 36, 52].

- [X] Find liturature about image processing aand object recognition.
- [X] Analyze liturature & explain how this relates.

## 2. Data Sets

- [X] Collect image sets for the AI to recognize.
- [X] What do these data sets specify.
- [X] What are the challenges with hand tracking? Volatile illumination conditions, occlusion, non-hand color similarity, and varying viewpoints.
- [X] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has lmited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub. 
  However, if the data is publicly available your program must contain a download function instead that you customize. 
  Write it using pythons 'request'

**Figure 2:** Dataset of hands doing different alphabet letters in ASL [^2].

## 3. Using Images

- [X] Place cool image into projects images in my directory (data set of its ability to be accurate).
- [X] Correct the following link, replace the fa with su, and the numbers to my reu numbers, change chart.png to file name.
- [X] If the image has been copied, you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption.

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm with Object Recognition

- [X] Identify the concrete data set that will be used.
- [X] Identify the conrete algorithm that completes the image processing for Hand Tracking.
- [X] Write the program.
- [X] Verify that it works.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]

## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.
