## Abstract

In this project we are studying the ability of AI to recognize and tag objects or subjects from a photo with accuracy

**Keywords:** ai, object recognition, image processing, computer vision. 

## 1. Introduction

- [ ] Find liturature about image processing.
- [ ] Find liturature about object recognition.
- [ ] Analyze liturature.

## 2. Data Sets

- [ ] Collect image sets for the AI to recognize.
- [ ] What do these data sets specify.
- [ ] What are the challenges with Object Recognition? Accuracy.

## 3. Using Images

- [ ] Place cool image into projects images in my directory (data set of its ability to be accurate).
- [ ] Correct the following link, replace the fa with su, and the numbers to my reu numbers, change chart.png to file name.
- [ ] If the image has been copied, you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption.
- [ ]

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of an AI algorithm with Object Recognition

- [ ] Identify the concrete data set that will be used.
- [ ] Identify the conrete algorithm that completes the image processing for Object Recognition.
- [ ] Write the program.
- [ ] Verify that it works.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

- [ ] Gregor Von Laszewski

## 9. References

- [ ] Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
  one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
  the first square bracket.
